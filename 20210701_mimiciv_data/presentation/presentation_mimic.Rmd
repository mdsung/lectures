# Introduction
---
## MIMIC-III
* database provided critical care data for over 40,000 patients admitted to ICU at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC). 
* deidentified, and patient identifiers were removed 

---
## MIMIC-IV
* MIMIC-IV is intended to carry on the success of MIMIC-III and support a broad set of applications within healthcare.
* MIMIC-IV adopts a modular approach to data organization, highlighting data provenance and facilitating both individual and combined use of disparate data sources.
*

## Methods
### Acquisition
  - Inclusion criteria
      - who were admitted to the BIDMC ED or any the ICU, 2008 - 2019.
  - Extracted from the respective hospital databases
  - A master patient list was created 
  - All source tables were filtered to only rows related to patients in the master patient list.

### Preparation
- The data were reorganized to better facilitate retrospective data analysis. 
  - the de-normalization of tables
  - removal of audit trails
  - reorganization into fewer tables
  - to simplify retrospective analysis of the database. 
- Data cleaning steps were not performed
  - to ensure the data reflects a real-world clinical dataset.

---

## Methods
### Deidentify
  - Patient identifiers as stipulated by HIPAA were removed. 
  - Patient identifiers were replaced using a random cipher, resulting in deidentified integer identifiers for patients, hospitalizations, and ICU stays. 
  - Structured data were filtered using look up tables and allow lists. 
  - If necessary, a free-text deidentification algorithm was applied to remove PHI from free-text. 
  - Finally, date and times were shifted randomly into the future using an offset measured in days. A single date shift was assigned to each subject_id. As a result, the data for a single patient are internally consistent.

## MIMIC-Waveform (MIMIC III)
- Waveforms almost always include one or more ECG signals, and often include continuous arterial blood pressure (ABP) waveforms, fingertip photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals, and respiration, with additional waveforms (up to 8 simultaneously) as available. 
- Numerics typically include heart and respiration rates, SpO2, and systolic, mean, and diastolic blood pressure, together with others as available. 
- Recording lengths also vary; most are a few days in duration, but some are shorter and others are several weeks long.
